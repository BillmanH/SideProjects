# Statistics
Ongoing learning on statistics and machine learning. Quick ad-hoc projects and [Schnapsidee](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Schnapsidee). This is really my junk drawer, however I often find myself pulling things from here into projects that I'm working on.

## Cloud
Quick scripts to access cloud APIs and other rest-like resources.

## Dice Games
I'm not good at gambling, but sometimes I like to hack out the odds and see if I can improve my strategy.

## IOT
Raspberry pi or Arduino code that I wrote, and most likely abandoned.

## Models
One off model templates so that I can come back to them if I need a model on the fly.

* `Survey Responder` - Generates fake survey data. Has a function for adding bias to specific demographics. Useful for testing and POC.

## Stat Testing
Quick stats and formulas. Some are handy from time to time.

* `Shap Attack` - notebooks from a Deep Dive I gave for some people at my work. Shows the value of SHAP model explainers and how to calculate them "by hand".

## Udacity
I did some Udacity course a long way back. Sometimes I copy some of the code into new projects.

## Web analytics
Some basic stuff for looking at web data.
