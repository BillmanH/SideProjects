# Statistics
I'm taking a bunch of statistics courses and I want to translate all of the exorcises into python. 

##dice_roll.py:
From Kahn Academy - intro to probability/statistics

##Udacity
###Intro Material - Machine Learning.py
Summary of Native Bayes:
first machine learning,
uses bayes rule,
Laplaccia smoother,
Bag of words,
linear regression

I also added some of my own scripts in **city_data_to_excel.py** to export that file put Boston data to DF, CSV and make a corelation matrix graph.
